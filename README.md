The Volume Control by Hand Gesture Project is a smart system that allows users to control the volume of their device using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the project detects hand movements in real-time and adjusts the system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger. This hands-free control mechanism enhances user interaction and accessibility for media players, presentations, or any audio application.

Features
Real-time hand gesture detection using a webcam.
Dynamic volume adjustment based on the size of the hand gesture.
Visual feedback for the detected gesture and volume levels.
Works in any lighting condition with basic hand tracking.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for implementing the logic.
OpenCV: For hand gesture detection and image processing.
Mediapipe: To track hand landmarks for gesture recognition.
PyCaw: For controlling system audio.
